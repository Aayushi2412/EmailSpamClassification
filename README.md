# EmailSpamClassification
Most of us should be familiar with spam emails. Cisco defines it as unwanted junk email sent 
out in bulk to an indiscriminate recipient list. Typically, spam is sent for commercial 
purposes. It can be sent in massive volume by botnets, networks of infected computers.
Therefore, spam email filtering is an essential feature for email services such as Outlook and 
Gmail. Services providers are extensively using Machine learning techniques to filter and 
classify them successfully.
This project deals with classifying spam and not spam emails/SMSs using some Machine Learning Algorithms like Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine Classifier. Natural Language Processisng is also used in the text pre-processing to make the dataset suitable for the algorithms.
